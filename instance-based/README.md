# 📘 Instance-Based Learning in Machine Learning

## 🔷 What is Instance-Based Learning?

Instance-based learning (IBL) is a type of machine learning where the model:

- Memorizes all the training data (instances).
- Makes predictions by comparing a new example to the stored instances.
- Does not build an explicit model during training — training is essentially just storing data.

## 📊 Examples of Instance-Based Algorithms:

- ✅ k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
- ✅ Radius Neighbors Classifier
- ✅ Locally Weighted Regression (LWR)
- ✅ Case-Based Reasoning (CBR)

## 🧪 Why use IBL?

- ✅ No training time (other than storing).
- ✅ Can adapt to complex decision boundaries.
- ✅ Simple & interpretable.

**⚠️ But:**

- Slow at prediction time (must compare to all instances).
- Sensitive to noise & irrelevant features.
