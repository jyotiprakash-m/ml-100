# 📘 Machine Learning: Batch Model Example

## 🔷 What is a Batch Learning Model?

Batch learning (also called offline learning) is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on the **entire dataset at once**. Once trained, the model is deployed and does not update incrementally. New data requires retraining the model.

## 🛠️ Steps to Build a Batch Model

### 1️⃣ Data Collection

- Gather all available data before training.
- Examples: CSV files, databases, APIs.

### 2️⃣ Data Preprocessing

- Handle missing values.
- Encode categorical variables.
- Scale numerical features.

### 3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Analyze data distributions.
- Detect outliers and anomalies.

### 4️⃣ Feature Engineering & Selection

- Construct or extract useful features.
- Remove irrelevant or redundant ones.

### 5️⃣ Model Training

- Choose a suitable algorithm (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree).
- Train the model on the full dataset.

### 6️⃣ Model Evaluation

- Test on a holdout set or via cross-validation.
- Evaluate using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall.

### 7️⃣ Model Deployment

- Deploy the trained model.
- Use it to make predictions on unseen (but similar) data.

## ✅ Advantages of Batch Learning

- Simpler implementation.
- Good for stable, non-changing data.

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Needs retraining for new data.
- Not suitable for streaming or rapidly changing environments.
