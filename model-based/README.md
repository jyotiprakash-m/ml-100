# Model-Based Learning

## ðŸ”· What is Model-Based Learning?

Model-Based Learning involves assuming an underlying relationship between input features and output labels. In this approach:

- A model is trained to approximate this relationship by learning parameters (or weights) from the training data.
- Once trained, the model generalizes its understanding to make predictions on unseen data.

## ðŸš€ Examples of Model-Based Algorithms

Here are some algorithms that fall under the Model-Based Learning category:

1. **Linear Regression**
2. **Logistic Regression**
3. **Decision Trees**
4. **Random Forests**
5. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
6. **Neural Networks**

> In Model-Based Learning, the model builds an _explicit mathematical representation_ of the data.

| **Aspect**     | **Instance-Based**                                                                 | **Model-Based**                              |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Training**   | Store instances                                                                    | Fit a model                                  |
| **Prediction** | Compare to stored data                                                             | Use the learned model                        |
| **Speed**      | Fast training, slow prediction                                                     | Slow training, fast prediction               |
| **Examples**   | k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Radial Basis Function (RBF), Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) | Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest (RF) |

Model-Based Learning provides a generalization by building a model that can make predictions efficiently after training, unlike Instance-Based Learning, which relies on the training data for every prediction.
